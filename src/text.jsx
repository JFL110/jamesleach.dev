            I have been developing my coding skills ever since my first website at age eleven.
            I take pride in writing clean, well-tested code and love taking on a challenge through design to implementation.
            I enjoy training others and am known for having the knowledge, approachability and practical attitude to help everyone get the job done.

            In my recent roles, I have enjoyed taking on ownership of delivery.
            I believe that an agile approach, realistic goals and involving engineers early on leads
            to features that are released on time and provide real value for clients and users.
