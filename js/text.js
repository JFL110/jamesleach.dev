            Beginning with my first website at age eleven, I have been coding for over 17 years. 
           In this time I&apos;ve learnt to write clean, well-tested and performant code and to identify problems before they happen.
           I am known for approachability, great quality work and creating tooling that makes life better for the whole team.

        <p>Recent professional projects range from educational platforms to financial administration systems used to
        manage millions of contracts across the globe.
      
        In the latter, I specialised in Java and SQL based Extract Transform Load processes handling gigabytes of financial data in real time.
        I advanced the framework, trained and supervised developers to use it, and so cut the time to create new features. 

        I also improved throughput and stability by optimising queries, database structure and tackling concurrency based issues.
        
        During my time on the project, both client satisfaction and sales of new enhancements greatly improved.
