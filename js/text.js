                I have been developing my coding skills ever since my first website at age eleven.
                I take pride in writing clean, well-tested code and love taking on a challenge through design to implementation.
                I enjoy training others and am known for having the knowledge, approachability and practical attitude to help everyone get the job done.

        <p>Recent professional projects range from educational platforms to financial administration systems used to
        manage millions of contracts across the globe.

        In the latter, I specialised in Java and SQL based Extract Transform Load processes handling gigabytes of financial data in real time.
        I advanced the framework, trained and supervised developers to use it, and so cut the time to create new features.

        I also improved throughput and stability by optimising queries, database structure and tackling concurrency based issues.

        During my time on the project, both client satisfaction and sales of new enhancements greatly improved.
